These tools provide on-call schedule functionality by using the
Schedule::Oncall module.

An example schedule is named "test-sched".

sched-report
	generates on-call schedule tables and identifies the individual
	who is on call. also provides a summary report which does not
	show the table, but instead only the on-call person and the
	associated contact information.

	requires the following modules:

	Schedule::Oncall
	Date::Manip

sched-populate
    	produces "person" entries for a schedule by querying an ldap
	server. the output of this can be directly included as part
	of a schedule configuration file.

	requires this module:

    	Net::LDAP
